      <h2>Market Profitability Analysis: France vs Europe</h2>
      <p>This project explores financial sales data to identify which factors most influence profit, with a focus on France and a comparison to the broader European market. Key steps include: Data cleaning and preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Correlation analysis (France vs Europe), Visualisations using Plotly and Seaborn, and Business-style presentation of findings.</p>

      <h2>Credit Risk Prediction (ML Project)</h2>
      <p>In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan using the German Credit dataset (UCI repository).
I applied data preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding and scaling, then trained a balanced Random Forest classifier.
The model achieved an accuracy of ~73% and an AUC score of ~0.79.
I also analyzed feature importance and visualized the ROC curve to evaluate the model's performance.
Tools used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib</p>

      <h2>Visualising User Sentiment in Spotify Reviews</h2>
      <p>Analysed user review text data from Spotify by cleaning the text, separating positive and negative sentiment, and identifying the most frequent words.
        Utilised Python (Pandas, NLTK, WordCloud) for sentiment analysis and created custom visualisations using a Spotify logo mask.</p>
